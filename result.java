 * RESULT:
 * a class which takes care of the output files
 * that the telescopes would have to return to the server.
 * Here, we can utilize the power of JAVA to write 
 * methods to send pictures and text over a network.
 * 
 * Other users could build on this platform. As 'result' is a 
 * proper class, different networks may write additional code 
 * to send different data types over a network.
 * 
 * The concept stays the same in all cases.
